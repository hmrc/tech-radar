# Principle: Data Driven Services

# Context

Customer should get a complete picture of the data that is held in the system when they use digital services.

# Problem(s)

# Rationale

A customer should be able to see all the relevant details when they log into their tax account. This helps curating the data that HMRC holds for all the customer as they can report any inconsistency. It also helps segregating data into logical customer centric domains which help in creating rich API functionality.

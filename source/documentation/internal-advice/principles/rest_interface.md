# Principle: REST based interfaces

# Context

REST will be the default interfacing standard of digital services.

# Problem(s)

All the legacy systems are batch processing applications. REST forces synchronous communication between the front end and backend systems. This change in the end-to-end communication model requires large scale transformation approach. 

# Rationale

REpresentational State Transfer (REST) protocol relies on stateless client server interactions which are cacheable on the server. This protocol provides all the salient advantages which allow the developers to make a robust scalable API based application which can allow build functionalities to be reused and scaled as required. This protocol also allows complex system of records broken down into easily accessible functionalities for 3rd party developers.

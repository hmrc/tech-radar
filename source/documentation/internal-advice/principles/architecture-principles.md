# Architecture Principles

(TODO: add rationale structure)

1. Build small, release fast (TODO: add rationale include reference to microservices)
2. Independently deployable services
3. Design for observation
4. Design for testability
5. Use mature, mainstream technologies
6. Smart nodes, dumb pipes
7. Reactive design
8. Automation over manual repetition
9. Design for multiple active data centres
10. Secure design (TODO: add rationale calling out access and integration specifically)
11. Design for multiple suppliers
12. Design for multiple consumers
13. Reuse existing services wherever possible
14. Design with the Fallacies of Distributed Computing in mind
15. Code in the open
16. [REST based Interfaces](rest_interfaces.md)
17. Data Driven Services
18. [API First](api-first.md)
19. Design for Scale and Availability (TODO: add rationale with disclaimer, per case basis)
